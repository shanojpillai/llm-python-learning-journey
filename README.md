# LLM Python Learning Journey

A hands-on learning project exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) through practical Python applications. This repository documents a step-by-step journey from basic LLM integration to advanced techniques, with each day building upon previous knowledge.

## Project Structure

- day-01-local-qa-app: Building a Local LLM Q&A Application with Ollama
- shared: Common utilities and resources used across different days
- [More days will be added as the journey continues]

## Getting Started

Each day's folder contains its own README with specific setup instructions.

## Learning Objectives

The overall goal of this project is to build practical skills in:
- Python development for AI applications
- Working with open-source LLMs
- Git version control
- Software architecture and design patterns
- LLM prompt engineering and optimization
