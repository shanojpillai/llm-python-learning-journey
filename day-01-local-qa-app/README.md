## Project Purpose
This project serves as a practical introduction to building applications with Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically focusing on running open-source models locally on CPU hardware. By creating this Q&A assistant, you'll learn essential skills that form the foundation for more advanced LLM-based applications while practicing good software development practices.

## Why This Project Matters

### Practical LLM Application Development
Building a local LLM application teaches you how to integrate LLMs into practical applications without relying on cloud-based API services. This gives you:
- Full control over your models and data
- No usage costs or rate limits
- Flexibility to customize models for specific use cases
- Privacy and security benefits from keeping data local

### Transferable Skills
The skills developed during this project transfer directly to more complex LLM applications:

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Learning how to structure effective prompts for LLMs is a fundamental skill that applies to all LLM applications, regardless of model or platform.

2. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implementing fallback systems when the primary model fails teaches resilient application design, critical for production-grade AI systems.

3. **Context Management**: Handling conversation context effectively is essential for all chat-based LLM applications.

4. **User Interface Design**: Creating intuitive interfaces for AI interaction is a universal requirement for user-facing AI applications.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Learning how to optimize model parameters and application performance for CPU-based models builds skills that transfer to all LLM deployment scenarios.

## Question-Driven Development Approach
This project follows a question-driven development approach, where we:

1. **Ask key questions** about requirements and functionality
2. **Research and explore** possible solutions
3. **Implement** targeted solutions that address specific questions
4. **Reflect** on what we've learned and formulate new questions

This approach aligns with how real-world AI projects evolve and helps build critical thinking skills alongside technical skills.

## Learning Path Progression
This project represents the starting point of a learning journey:

1. **Day 1**: Basic Q&A application with local LLM (current project)
2. **Future**: Document Q&A capabilities to enable answering questions about specific documents
3. **Future**: Specialized domain adaptation and fine-tuning
4. **Future**: Multi-modal capabilities (text + images)
5. **Future**: Production deployment strategies
